# Coding Shout
Frustrated of staring at your screen waiting for the result of your submission on Online Judges to pop up? Relax and let this extension notify you as soon as the results appear. It uses text to speech to say the result, or if you prefer being silently notified, there is an option for that too.

Note that it is not tested with regards to System testing and may or maynot work for it.

## Supported Judges
* Codechef
* Codeforces
* AtCoder (Beta) - thanks to Michal Å vagerka
